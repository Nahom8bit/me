## What I Do

I help small businesses solve operational problems through a combination of design, software, and business strategy.

My work sits at the intersection of three disciplines:
- **Business development**: identifying market gaps and building product strategies
- **Design**: creating brand identities, UI/UX systems, and marketing materials
- **Software**: building practical tools (primarily POS systems and business automation)

I'm self-taught across all three areas. My approach is hands-on and practical—I focus on what works in real-world conditions, particularly for African small and medium businesses.

## Approach

I don't believe in waiting for perfect conditions. I believe in starting with what you have and improving as you go.

My process:
1. Identify the real problem (not just what people say they want)
2. Build the simplest version that solves it
3. Test with actual users
4. Iterate based on what breaks

I care about work that creates tangible value—systems that help businesses run better, brands that help products sell, software that solves real operational problems.

I'm still learning. Every project teaches me something new about what works and what doesn't.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm open to:
- **Freelance projects**: Brand design, UI/UX work, software development
- **Collaborations**: Particularly with people building products for African markets
- **Partnerships**: For DIY Addis and Adey Threads as they scale
